# My AGS V3 configuration

## does have:
* player
* time
* workspaces(for hyprland)

## TODO
* remake a time widget to use AstalTime library
* make a selectable Mpris source for player
* make player to have a popup
* make a Tray
* make shortcuts
* make a fileDock
* make workspaces nameable
* maybe make some notes on the way, because looking at AGS docs I could say: "AGS изучен на 5%"
